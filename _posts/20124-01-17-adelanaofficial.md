# 5 Principles For Designing A Smartwatch Interface. ⌚

In 2021, the worldwide smartwatch market was approximately 202.6 million users. 

That number of users is expected to increase by 2026 reaching about 231.3 million users. 
That’s about 29 million new users using familiar a yet new technology. 

As a designer, if you haven’t designed apps for a smartwatch yet, chances are you’ll have to very soon.

## Understand The Core Functionality 🚂

_“It’s important to consider both the capabilities and limitations of the platform when designing apps for wearables._

_Research what is possible and what physical capabilities are available on the device. Without researching first, you can end up with unfeasible design ideas.” ~ by Nick Babich_

📃 This simply means smartwatch apps require the same (sometimes more) amount of adequate research. Developing smartwatch apps can be challenging for both designers and engineers due to their limited screen real estate.

⁉️ To understand the core functionality of a smartwatch app, a designer needs to ask these questions. What is the most critical information needed to be displayed? Who is the target audience? Will the user be able to understand at first glance? How fast will a user be able to complete a task?

📝 Note: the average interaction time for a smartwatch session is 5-8 seconds long, this means an interface needs to focus on showing the user quick, easy-to-comprehend information that can be consumed at a “Glance”.
